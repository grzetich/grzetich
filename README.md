# Hey, I'm Ed 👋

Senior Technical Writer exploring how AI changes the way we build and consume developer documentation.

**Currently:**
- Researching API documentation formats optimized for AI consumption
- Building MCP servers that bridge conversational AI to REST APIs
- Writing a book about documentation infrastructure for the AI era

**Recent work:**
- [docs-cost-calculator](https://doc-cost.vercel.app) — See what your API docs cost AI to read. Paste any structured documentation, compare token counts across formats.
- [Oh My Clawd](https://grzeti.ch) — A comedy web series about a techie who misconfigures things while pursuing DevRel work.

**Background:** 15+ years in technical documentation across AWS, Mastercard, and General Dynamics. I like making complex things clear.
